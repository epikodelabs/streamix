/**
 * Creates a stream operator that emits only the first `count` values from the source stream
 * and then completes.
 *
 * This operator is a powerful tool for controlling the length of a stream. It consumes values
 * from the source one by one, and as long as the total number of values emitted is less than
 * `count`, it passes them through to the output. Once the count is reached, it stops
 * processing the source and signals completion to its downstream consumers. This is especially
 * useful for managing finite segments of large or infinite streams.
 *
 * @template T The type of the values in the source and output streams.
 * @param count The maximum number of values to take from the beginning of the stream.
 * @returns An `Operator` instance that can be used in a stream's `pipe` method.
