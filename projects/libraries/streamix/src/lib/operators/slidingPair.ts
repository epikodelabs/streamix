/**
 * Creates a stream operator that emits pairs of values from the source stream,
 * where each pair consists of the previous and the current value.
 *
 * This operator is a powerful tool for comparing consecutive values in a stream.
 * It maintains an internal state to remember the last value it received. For
 * each new value, it creates a tuple of `[previousValue, currentValue]` and
 * emits it to the output stream.
 *
 * The very first value emitted will have `undefined` as its "previous" value.
 *
 * @template T The type of the values in the source stream.
 * @returns An `Operator` instance that can be used in a stream's `pipe` method,
 * emitting tuples of `[T | undefined, T]`.
