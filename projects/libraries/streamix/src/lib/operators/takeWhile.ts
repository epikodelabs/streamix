/**
 * Creates a stream operator that emits values from the source stream as long as
 * a predicate returns true.
 *
 * This operator is a conditional limiter. It consumes values from the source stream
 * and applies the `predicate` function to each. As long as the predicate returns `true`,
 * the value is passed through to the output stream. The first time the predicate returns
 * a falsy value, the operator stops emitting and immediately completes the output stream.
 * The value that caused the predicate to fail is not emitted.
 *
 * This is useful for taking a contiguous block of data from a stream that meets a certain
 * condition, such as processing user input until an invalid entry is made.
 *
 * @template T The type of the values in the source and output streams.
 * @param predicate The function to test each value. Receives the value and its index. `true` means to continue emitting,
 * and `false` means to stop and complete. It can be synchronous or asynchronous.
 * @returns An `Operator` instance that can be used in a stream's `pipe` method.
