/**
 * Creates a stream operator that applies a transformation function to each value
 * emitted by the source stream.
 *
 * This operator is a fundamental part of stream processing. It consumes each value
 * from the source, passes it to the `transform` function, and then emits the result
 * of that function. This is a one-to-one mapping, meaning the output stream will
 * have the same number of values as the source stream, but with potentially different
 * content and/or type.
 *
 * @template T The type of the values in the source stream.
 * @template R The type of the values in the output stream.
 * @param transform The transformation function to apply to each value. It receives
 * the value and its index. This function can be synchronous or asynchronous.
 * @returns An `Operator` instance that can be used in a stream's `pipe` method.
