/**
 * Creates a stream operator that maps each value from the source stream to an "inner" stream
 * and merges all inner streams concurrently into a single output stream.
 *
 * For each value from the source stream:
 * 1. The `project` function is called with the value and its index.
 * 2. The returned value is normalized into a stream using {@link fromAny}.
 * 3. The inner stream is consumed concurrently with all other active inner streams.
 * 4. Emitted values from all inner streams are interleaved into the output stream
 *    in the order they are produced, without waiting for other inner streams to complete.
 *
 * This operator is useful for performing parallel asynchronous operations while
 * preserving all emitted values in a merged output.
 *
 * @template T The type of values in the source stream.
 * @template R The type of values emitted by the inner and output streams.
 * @param project A function that maps a source value and its index to either:
 *   - a {@link Stream<R>},
 *   - a {@link MaybePromise<R>} (value or promise),
 *   - or an array of `R`.
 * @returns An {@link Operator} instance that can be used in a stream's `pipe` method.
