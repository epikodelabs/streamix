 * Creates a stream operator that prepends a specified value to the beginning of the stream.

 * After this initial emission, it begins to pull and emit values from the
 * source stream as they become available.
 *
 * @template T The type of the values in the stream.
 * @param initialValue The value to be emitted as the first item in the stream.
 * @returns An `Operator` instance that can be used in a stream's `pipe` method.
