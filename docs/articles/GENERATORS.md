# ???? From RxJS Maximalist to Generator Fan

I used to solve everything with RxJS ??? then I learned async generators. Generators are linear, debuggable, and (with [Streamix](https://actioncrew.github.io/streamix)) still reactive. Fewer marble diagrams, better sleep. And when the app only needs one snapshot, you can **downgrade** your pipeline to a single `await stream.query()` ??? pragmatic, simple, and safe. ????

## ???? **The Maximalist Era**

I used to be *that* developer. You know the type:

- `switchMap` for button clicks ???  
- `combineLatest` for boolean logic ????  
- Every async operation became a marble-diagram masterpiece ????

My pipelines looked like this:

```javascript
const userDashboard$ = userId$.pipe(
  switchMap(id =>
    combineLatest(getUserProfile(id), getUserPosts(id))
  ),
  mergeMap(([profile, posts]) => 
    from(posts).pipe(
      concatMap(post => getPostComments(post.id)),
      scan((acc, comments) => [...acc, comments], [])
    )
  )
);
```

**The moment of truth:** When a teammate asked *"What does this do?"*... even I couldn't answer clearly. ????

---

## ??? **Enter Generators: The Awakening**

Then someone showed me async generators, and everything changed:

```javascript
async function* fetchUserData(userId) {
  const profile = await getUserProfile(userId);
  yield profile;

  const posts = await getUserPosts(userId);
  for (const post of posts) {
    yield post;

    const comments = await getPostComments(post.id);
    yield { post, comments };
  }
}
```

**Holy readability!** ????

- ??? **Linear** ??? read top to bottom  
- ??? **Debuggable** ??? step through like normal code  
- ??? **Simple** ??? no marble diagrams required

---

## ???? **Streamix: Reactive + Generators = ??????**

I still loved operators, so Streamix was the perfect fit ??? Rx-style operators applied to generator streams:

```typescript
import { Stream, debounceTime, distinctUntilChanged } from '@epikode/streamix';

async function* searchFeature(searchInput: Stream<string>) {
  const processed = searchInput.pipe(
    debounceTime(300),
    distinctUntilChanged()
  );

  for await (const query of processed) {
    if (query.trim()) {
      const results = await searchAPI(query);
      yield* results;
    }
  }
}
```

Readable, reactive, and still composed ??? without late-night marble-diagram angst. ????

## ???? **Downgrade pipelines to one value (the practical trick)**

Here???s the part I wish someone had told me earlier: you can keep your generator pipelines **and** expose a tiny, explicit bridge for imperative code that only needs **one snapshot**. That???s what `query()` is for.

### What `query()` should do (recommended semantics)
1. **If a latest value exists**, `query()` **resolves immediately** with it.  
2. **Otherwise**, `query()` **waits for the next emission** and resolves once it arrives.  
3. **Multiple callers** awaiting `query()` on the same subject all resolve on that same next emission.  
4. `query()` is a **read-only** convenience ??? it doesn???t destructively consume the latest snapshot.  

### Example ??? build pipeline, expose snapshot
Generator pipeline (readable and testable):

```typescript
async function* buildUserDashboard(userId$: Stream<T>) {
  for await (const id of userId$) {
    const profile = await getUserProfile(id);
    const posts = await getUserPosts(id);
    yield { id, profile, posts };
  }
}
```

Wire it to a subject that keeps the latest snapshot:

```typescript
const dashboardSubject = createSubject();
dashboardSubject.pipe(buildUserDashboard(userId$)); // Actually we need converter here
```

Now callers who want a single snapshot can just do:

```typescript
async function onOpenDashboard() {
  const snapshot = await dashboardSubject.query(); // Downgrade to one value
  render(snapshot);
}
```

**Why this matters**
- ??? **Interop**: imperative handlers, startup code, and tests can consume streams simply.  
- ??? **Migration-friendly**: adopt generator streams incrementally without refactoring every consumer.  
- ??? **Predictable**: `query()` semantics are explicit and easy to document/test.

---

## ???? **Subjects Without Overthinking**

Hot Subjects are great for multicasting. They let pipelines broadcast a computed snapshot to multiple listeners. The `query()` escape hatch keeps things pragmatic ??? no need to force `for await` everywhere. Use Subjects for sharing and `query()` for one-shot reads.

```typescript
const subject = createSubject<number>();
subject.next(42);
const latest = await subject.query(); // 42 (immediate if latest exists)
```

---

## ?????? **Before vs After: Real Example**

### ???? **The Old Me (RxJS Maximalist):**
```typescript
const searchResults$ = searchInput$.pipe(
  debounceTime(300),
  distinctUntilChanged(),
  switchMap(query => 
    query ? searchAPI(query).pipe(catchError(() => of([]))) : of([])
  )
);
```

### ???? **The New Me (Streamix + Generators):**
```typescript
async function* search(searchInput: Stream<T>) {
  const debounced = searchInput.pipe(
    debounceTime(300),
    distinctUntilChanged()
  );

  for await (const query of debounced) {
    if (query) {
      try {
        yield* await searchAPI(query);
      } catch {
        yield* []; // keep calm and carry on
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Which would you rather debug at 2 AM? ?????????????

## ???? **Lessons Learned**

### **1. Admit Overengineering** ?????????????  
If explaining your code needs a whiteboard, simplify it.

### **2. Embrace Simplicity** ????  
Not every async operation needs another observable.

### **3. Pick the Right Tool** ???????

| **Use Case** | **Best Choice** |
|-------------:|----------------:|
| UI events, real-time data | **Personal preferences** ???? |
| Sequential data pipelines, pagination | **Streamix + Generators** ???? |
| Single-value requests, tests | **Promises / `query()`** ???? |

---

## ???? **Try It Yourself**

```javascript
import { pipe, map, filter, take } from '@epikode/streamix';

async function* processData() {
  const numbers = from([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]).pipe(
    filter(n => n % 2 === 0),
    map(n => n * 2),
    take(3)
  );
  yield* numbers; // 4, 8, 12
}
```

---

## ???? **The Bottom Line**

Reactive programming isn???t about using every operator in the toolbox. It???s about being **readable, pragmatic, and interoperable**. Build readable pipelines ??? and when the rest of your app only needs one value, **downgrade** them with `query()`. Practical, testable, and keeps everyone sleeping more soundly. ????
