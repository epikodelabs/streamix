(Well done!)</p><h2 id="_2-0-16" tabindex="-1">2.0.16 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-0-16" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2.0.16&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Comprehensive JSDoc comments were added to all public functions. The codebase now features stronger TypeScript types, leading to better code completion and compile-time error checking.</p><h2 id="_2-0-15" tabindex="-1">2.0.15 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-0-15" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2.0.15&quot;">​</a></h2><p>All streams are now <strong>multicast</strong> by default, enabling shared execution and improved performance across multiple subscribers</p><h2 id="_2-0-14" tabindex="-1">2.0.14 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-0-14" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2.0.14&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We have added AbortController support to most stream creators to enable proper cancellation and resource cleanup when subscribers unsubscribe. This allows streams to stop producing values promptly, avoid memory leaks, and clean up internal iterators or event listeners automatically.</p><h2 id="_2-0-12" tabindex="-1">2.0.12 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-0-12" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2.0.12&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Refactored core operators to use pure AsyncIterator logic without relying on Subject, resulting in cleaner and more predictable behavior. Added the <code>observeOn</code> operator for microtask/macrotask scheduling. Renamed the <code>value</code> property of Subject to <code>snappy</code> to better reflect its intention and humorous design.</p><h2 id="_2-0-11" tabindex="-1">2.0.11 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-0-11" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2.0.11&quot;">​</a></h2><p>All built-in operators now fully support asynchronous callbacks. You can provide async functions to operators such as <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, <code>reduce</code>, and custom operators without manual workarounds or hacks. Receivers can now be asynchronous. Streamix handles awaiting async callbacks internally, ensuring proper flow control and error propagation.</p><h2 id="_2-0-10" tabindex="-1">2.0.10 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-0-10" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2.0.10&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Both <code>createSubject()</code> and <code>createBehaviorSubject()</code> now expose a synchronously accessible <code>.value</code> property that immediately reflects the latest value passed to <code>.next()</code>, even before it has propagated to all subscribers.</p><h2 id="_2-0-8" tabindex="-1">2.0.8 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-0-8" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2.0.8&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Improved tracking of pending readers to prevent negative counts and ensure buffer slots are released exactly once.</p><h2 id="_2-0-7" tabindex="-1">2.0.7 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-0-7" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2.0.7&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The buffer implementation was corrected to ensure proper synchronization between writers and readers, especially in scenarios involving concurrent access and stream completion. Previously, the <code>readSemaphore</code> was released for all active readers regardless of whether they were actually pending, leading to incorrect wakeups and race conditions.</p><h2 id="_2-0-6" tabindex="-1">2.0.6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-0-6" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2.0.6&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Due to the asynchronous nature of the internal buffer, <code>getValue()</code> is now an async method returning <code>Promise&lt;T | undefined&gt;</code>. This ensures consistent and race-free access to the latest buffered value across concurrent consumers.</p><h2 id="_2-0-5" tabindex="-1">2.0.5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-0-5" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2.0.5&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Both Subject and BehaviorSubject now use SingleValueBuffer internally. It offers a more direct and efficient backpressure mechanism for single-value streams (like Subjects and BehaviorSubjects). Unlike CyclicBuffer, it doesn&#39;t maintain a history of values beyond the latest one, simplifying the internal logic and potentially reducing memory overhead for these specific use cases. The SingleValueBuffer explicitly provides a value getter, which is a significant departure and a key feature compared to the generic CyclicBuffer.</p><h2 id="_2-0-1" tabindex="-1">2.0.1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-0-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2.0.1&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Fully refactored all built-in operators, replacing complex subscription management with a clean, unified async iterator-based design. Operators now implement the async iterable protocol (<code>next()</code>, <code>return()</code>, <code>throw()</code>) directly, eliminating callback spaghetti and ensuring straightforward, predictable, and maintainable flow control. This approach improves resource management, unsubscription handling, and overall operator performance.</p><h2 id="_1-0-20" tabindex="-1">1.0.20 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-0-20" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1.0.20&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Operators in a pipeline were applied left to right — the first operator wrapped the source, followed by the next, and so on. Now operators are applied in reverse order, from right to left — the last operator wraps the source first. Streamix now includes many new built-in operators, enabling richer stream manipulation out of the box. <code>createMapper</code> method receives both input and output streams.</p><h2 id="_1-0-18" tabindex="-1">1.0.18 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-0-18" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1.0.18&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The <code>Subscription</code> type has been enhanced with two new methods: <code>listen</code> and <code>value</code>. The <code>listen</code> method allows for efficient tracking of stream updates. The <code>value</code> method gives direct access to the last emitted value, making it easier to retrieve the current state of a stream without additional boilerplate.</p><h2 id="_1-0-16" tabindex="-1">1.0.16 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-0-16" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1.0.16&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Streamix now features pull-based subjects, allowing subscribers to independently pull values at their own pace rather than receiving pushed emissions. This ensures that late subscribers can access past values without missing emissions, improving backpressure handling and memory efficiency. Subscriptions are now fully independent, preventing one subscriber’s lifecycle from affecting others. Additionally, pull-based subjects support async iteration (<code>for await...of</code>), making them more flexible for asynchronous workflows while enhancing error propagation and buffer management.</p><h2 id="_1-0-14" tabindex="-1">1.0.14 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-0-14" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1.0.14&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Various improvements and changes: updated test apps, renamed <code>StreamOperator</code> to <code>StreamMapper</code>, reorganized package structure, added debug configurations for jasmine scripts, removed emission abstraction, and corrected package metadata.</p><h2 id="_1-0-12" tabindex="-1">1.0.12 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-0-12" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1.0.12&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In version 1.0.12 of Streamix, several refactoring efforts were completed to enhance code organization and functionality. The <code>onIntersection</code> subscription was reimplemented as a subject, improving event handling efficiency. Additionally, multiple streams were converted into subjects without relying on semaphores, reducing potential synchronization issues. A fix was applied to ensure proper event dispatching from <code>fromEvent</code> streams, aligning them with other subscription types. Furthermore, code cleanup measures were taken, including the removal of unnecessary utility folders and dependencies updates. The ollama script was integrated into the changelog generation process, ensuring documentation consistency.
